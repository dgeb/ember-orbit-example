# Ember Orbit Demo

A simple demo that illustrates synchronization of two data sources with Orbit.js.

This demo is more of a proof of concept and should not be taken as an
example of "best practices". Orbit, which was written with
plain javascript, needs an Ember integration layer before use with Ember is
recommended.
