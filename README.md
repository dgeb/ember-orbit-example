# Ember App Kit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)

Ember App Kit aims to be the foundation for ambitious web applications built with Ember. It's intended to be used either on its own or as the base scaffolding for projects using [Ember Tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools), [generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember) and a hypothetical official [executable](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) at some point in the future.

This project has been extracted out of several real world applications and is actively used. Currently it covers the basics fairly well, but much still needs to be done. As we learn and as more contributors join in it continues to evolve. If you encounter any bugs, clunky features or missing documentation, just submit an issue and we'll respond ASAP.

At the very least, it helps setup your Ember.js applications directory structure.

We welcome ideas and experiments.

## Features

- Sane project structure
- ES6 module transpiler support (easy, future-proof modules)
- Module system-aware resolver (see [Referencing views](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/wiki/Referencing-Views) and [Using Ember loaders](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/wiki/Using-Ember-loaders))
- Transparent project compilation & minification for easy deploys via [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- Package management via [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)
- Optional support for CoffeeScript, SASS, LESS or Stylus
- Testing via QUnit, Ember Testing and Testem (with examples)
- Linting via JSHint (including module syntax)
- Catch-all `index.html` for easy reloading of pushState router apps
- Generators via [Loom](https://github.com/cavneb/loom-generators-ember-appkit) (to generate routes, controllers, etc.)

## Future Goals

- Easier to install 3rd party packages
- Faster, more intelligent builds
